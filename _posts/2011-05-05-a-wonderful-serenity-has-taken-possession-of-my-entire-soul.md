The phenomenon of icing has an important impact on the engine performance and water driving ability of ships, so it is necessary to carry out anti-icing tests during the development of ships. Effective anti-icing will have a significant impact on shipping and other fields. The main purpose of the new anti-icing equipment is to design a dual-use anti-icing equipment used on the hull surface or directly placed on the lake surface. The equipment has innovations in surface materials, thermal energy storage and other aspects. During the day, the device absorbs as much solar energy as possible through the light tracking device, and together with the heat energy generated by the engine, it is transmitted from the evaporative section of the heat pipe to the adiabatic section and then to the condensating section, which is stored by the phase change. After the temperature changes at night, the phase changes reversly compared with the day, and the heat energy stored during the day is released, making it difficult for the water near the device to freeze. We expect to make a complete set of equipment this year, which can be used in real life and ensure the integrity of the above functions and advantages. We
